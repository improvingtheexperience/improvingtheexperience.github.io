    Why Ask?
    Omit optional fields and think of other ways to collect data. Always ask yourself if the question can be inferred, postponed, or completely excluded.
    Data entry is increasingly automated. For example, mobile and wearable devices collect large amounts of data without the userâ€™s conscious awareness. Think of ways you can leverage social, conversational UI, SMS, email, voice, OCR, location, fingerprint, biometric, etc.
